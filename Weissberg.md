## Some Stuff About Me

Hello all. My name is Simon, and I am a first year Physics major.

Two of my hobbies are reading and playing the guitar.

I am interested in the field of Biomedical Engineering, specifically the designing of prosthetic and medical devices.


## My Prior Coding Experience

A big part of my prior coding experience comes from classes here at Adelphi like project lab and statistical mechanics where I used Python and a little Matlab.

## What I Am Interested In Learning This Semester

From this class, I am interested in learning the methods one uses to optimize their code and reduce runtime. Much of my prior experience has been primarily in just getting my code to work.
From another classes, Genetics, I am interested in learning about our genes and the deeper mechanics that govern them. From my other classes, my expectations are still quite vague.

## My Thoughts On LLMs

I think they are a very valuable resource, but one that it is very easy to become over relient on. 
They can be a wonderful source of targeted advice, information, and examples, but this is tempered by the fact that they may not always know what they are talking about.
This issue is not one that the internet is free of either: there are forums full of people on the internet who don't know what they are talking and I think AI should be treated with just as much caution when consulted.
In the end, AI is a tool as it exists right now, and-- if it is used responsibly-- I believe it can do a lot of good.
