I am a senior physics major here at Adelphi University. My goal right now is to attend graduate school for mechanical engineering with my physics background. I am also working on trying to get an engineering internship 
And as of writing this, I have a third interview scheduled on Thursday, February 19th.

My hobbies include reading novels, working with electronics, and playing games. My favorite novel that I recommend to anyone interested is called "Lord Of The Mysteries", it is a very rich novel with a lot of world-building and 
contains one of the most fascinating power systems in fiction that I have ever seen. My favorite games that I am playing right now are Rainbow Six Siege and Deadlock.

As for prior experience with coding. I have about 2 years in and out that I have worked with code. Most of it was spur-of-the-moment learning for projects, but I have had a few Python classes afterward that have reinforced my learning. I have most of my experience with Python 
and a little bit in MatLab

Why am I taking this class then? Well, truth be told, I am a graduating senior in about 3-4 months from now, and I just want a chill class that I can enjoy while not straying too far away from my major. My one gripe that I have with Adelphi's physics department is that 
After taking all the mandatory classes, there is nothing else to be offered by the major. I had finished with my graduation requirements since I was a junior, and I have just been drifting since there was nothing else for me to do. Well, as of writing this, I realize that 
this won't be the norm for others, but I really had grinded out all the classes, taking 17 - 18 credit semesters, but there really should be more to do. I shouldn't "run out of classes" in a university.
