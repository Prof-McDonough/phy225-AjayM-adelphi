## About Me
- My name is Braden Patterso. I am currently a junior physics major.
- I work for both the admissions office and the UCOMM office as a social media ambassador.
- I'm not completely set on a career plan yet but I'm thinking I would like to do something with electric motors for cars and other machines.

## Prior Coding Knowledge
- I don't really have any prior coding experience except for the very little bit of it I did in overleaf last semester with Professor Wright.

## What am I Interested in Learning?
- This semester, I am interested in learning more about how to code. As of right now I think it might be the most tedious and annoying thing I've done. However, that's just because I don't have that much training with it. As I learn more, I feel like it will get better.

## Thoughts on LLM's like ChatGPT
- I think that ChatGPT and LLM's are very useful and necessary resources when used correctly. I persoanlly use them to get ideas on how to start a project or some kind of work that I have due. However, when people use them for every little task, that's when it becomes scary and worrisome. I have some friends that talk to ChatGPT like it's their best friend and is capable of having a full on sentient conversation. In this case, I also believe that LLM's can be very degrading to younger people who are now unable to think for themselves and have to ask AI to do everything for them.
